# Screen Capture

This repository contains a cross platform Screen Capture Library currently
in development. The API is likely to change in the near future when more
drivers (Windows / Linux) will be added. This is experimental code.


## Roadmap

Currently I'm working on driver for Windows and Linux. The Mac
driver has been tested on just two Macs, a 10.9.5 and 10.10.2. Please let
me know when you've compiled and run this library successfully.

## Compiling on Mac


Execute the following in a terminal which will start the opengl 
test application that captures from the first display:

````sh
cd build
./release 64
````
